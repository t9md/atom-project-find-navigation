# :warning: [Deprecated] Don't use.

- Why? Because I no longer use this package in daily editing.  I use [narrow](https://atom.io/packages/narrow) instead.
- It's difficult to have motivation to maintain package I don't use.

Provides keyboard navigation for project-find-result.

# What's this?

Provide keyboard navigation for project-find-result of [find-and-replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace) package.  
find-and-replace provides `project-find:show` command which shows found entries in project.  
With this package you can navigate each match with keyboard.  

# Excuse

This package's code is greatly and directly depending on internal variables and functions of [find-and-replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace) provides.

So this package might not work in future version of find-and-replace.  
If code change made on find-and-replace was too big, I might give up this navigation hack package.  
So essentially this is proof of concept to evaluate how project-find's result pane navigation could be improved.  

# Features

Here is summary table of what project-find-navigation provides.

| available on | command               | pure project-find              | project-find-navigation                                                  |
|:-------------|:----------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| results-pane | confirm               | Jump to found entry and select | Jump to found entry with flashing effect, no select                      |
| results-pane | confirm-and-continue  | N/A                            | Scroll to found entry with flashing effect, focus remains on result pane |
| results-pane | show-next             | N/A                            | Select next item and then confirm-and-continue(auto preview)             |

| global       | next                  | N/A                            | goto next result                                                         |
| global       | prev                  | N/A                            | goto previous result                                                     |
| global       | activate-results-pane | N/A                            | Focus to results-pane if exists                                          |

Other features.

- Focus to result-pane by keymap.
- Highlight(decorate) found entries on editor, auto-cleared when result-pane destroyed.
- Open found entry in **adjacent** pane. This mean, if result-pane was on left pane open found entry on right pane when confirmed.

# Keymap

From v0.2.0, default keymap are provided for result-pane
But you still **need to set keymap for workspace**.

### On result pane

| keystroke      | command                             | action                                |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| `j`            | `project-find-navigation:show-next` | Visit next match                      |
| `k`            | `project-find-navigation:show-prev` | Visit previous match                  |
| `l`            | `core:move-right`                   | Expand matches                        |

### For keymap in text-editor

You have to set in your `keymap.cson`.

e.g.

```coffeescript
'atom-workspace:not([mini])':
  # This key override window:toggle-full-screen(I'm not using it).
  'ctrl-cmd-f': 'project-find-navigation:activate-results-pane'
  'ctrl-cmd-n': 'project-find-navigation:next'
  'ctrl-cmd-p': 'project-find-navigation:prev'
```

# Style

In your `styles.less`, you can tweak match entry's decoration like following.

```less
@import "syntax-variables";
atom-text-editor::shadow {
  .project-find-navigation-match .region {
    background-color: @syntax-selection-color;
    border: none;
  }
}
```
